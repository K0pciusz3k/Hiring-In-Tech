# Hiring In Tech & Candidate Experience: Utopia vs. Reality
As you may already know, we run an annual recruitment survey among the developer community in Berlin. This year we would like to invite you to “Hiring in Tech & Candidate Experience: Utopia vs. Reality”, a panel discussion moderated by Caissa, on December 6.


Our recent survey confirmed that the recruitment process in Berlin needs to be fixed. So, we are having a conversation between HR specialists, tech executives, and developers. Together, we hope to come up with ways companies in Berlin can improve their hiring process.
